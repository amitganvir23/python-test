## Tuples is imutable, it is similarly to array but the different is when you fixed the element then you cant change it.
## Use tubles instead of array list when your are not going to change data/values.


num1 = (4, 5, 3, 2)
#index: 0  1    ## Above index list. (indexing from front)
print(num1)     # print all element
print(num1[0])  # print element of index 0
print(num1[-1]) # Print last element of the list
print(num1[1:])
print(num1[1:3])
